Hey there! Welcome to my coursework repository. The repository contains the coursework completed as part of my Graduate Diploma ST2195 'Programming for Data Science'.

Part 1 - Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm
In this section, the focus is on implementing and understanding the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, specifically the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Part 2 - Analysis of US Flight Arrivial and Departure Data
The second part of the coursework involves analyzing flight arrival and departure details from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo. 
This dataset comprises flight details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008.
Utilising Packages from R and Python, the following questions were addressed:

(a) What are the best times and days of the week to minimise delays each year?

(b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.

(c) For each year, fit a logistic regression model for the probability of diverted US flights using as many features as possible from attributes of the departure date, the scheduled departure and arrival times, the coordinates and distance between departure and planned arrival airports, and the carrier. Visualize the coefficients across years.
